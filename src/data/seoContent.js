## Precision Meets Artistry in 3D Rendering

Sthyra provides high-end **3D Rendering Services** that bridge the gap between imagination and reality. Whether you are an architect pitching a concept or a developer launching a new project, our visuals provide the competitive edge you need.

### The Problem We Solve

Architectural drawings are technical. Clients often struggle to visualize the final outcome. Our 3D renderings translate technical CAD files into emotional, aspirational imagery that clients can understand and desire.

### Our Rendering Process

1.  **Modeling:** We create a detailed 3D digital twin of your design.
2.  **Texturing:** We apply physically accurate materials (PBR) to ensure realism.
3.  **Lighting:** We simulate real-world lighting conditions (daylight, dusk, artificial).
4.  **Post-Processing:** We add life—people, vegetation, and atmosphere—to create a lived-in feel.

Get accurate, beautiful renderings that accelerate your sales cycle.

## The Future of Real Estate Sales is VR

Gone are the days of static brochures. **Virtual Reality (VR) for Real Estate** allows prospective buyers to physically walk through a property that doesn't exist yet. Sthyra uses cutting-edge game engine technology (Unreal Engine 5) to create fully interactive environments.

### Benefits of VR in Real Estate

*   **Emotional Connection:** Buyers feel the scale and volume of the space.
*   **Customization:** Allow buyers to change flooring or wall colors in real-time.
*   **Global Reach:** Send a VR headset or a Pixel Streaming link to a client anywhere in the world.

### Pixel Streaming Technology

We leverage **Pixel Streaming** to deliver high-fidelity 3D experiences directly in a web browser, requiring no app downloads or powerful computers on the client side. This makes high-end interactive visualization accessible to everyone.

Lead the market with Sthyra's interactive solutions.

### Why Interactive?

*   **Higher Engagement:** Users spend 3x more time on a page with interactive content.
*   **Transparency:** Buyers can inspect every corner, building trust.
*   **Accessibility:** Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop without plugins.

We build these experiences using WebGL and Unreal Engine Pixel Streaming for maximum fidelity.

## The Digital Twin Advantage

A **Digital Twin** is more than just a 3D model; it's a living digital replica of your physical asset. For developers, this means having a master asset that can be used for:

1.  **Sales:** Virtual show flats.
2.  **Construction Monitoring:** Compare build progress against the twin.
3.  **Facility Management:** Tag assets within the 3D model for future maintenance.

Sthyra creates ultra-high-fidelity twins that serve as the foundation for your entire project lifecycle.

## High-Fidelity, Zero Friction

**Pixel Streaming** changes the game. Traditionally, high-quality walkthroughs required powerful gaming PCs. With Pixel Streaming, the heavy lifting is done in the cloud.

### How It Works

1.  We host your interactive model on a cloud server (AWS/Azure) with robust GPUs.
2.  The visual data is streamed to your client's device as a video feed.
3.  Client inputs (mouse/touch) are sent back to the server instantly.

The result? Putting a photorealistic, ray-traced walkthrough into the hands of a client on an iPhone or a standard laptop. This is the ultimate sales tool for luxury real estate.

## Selling the Dream

**Luxury Property Marketing** is not about specs; it's about feeling. It's about the warmth of the morning sun on a marble floor, the view from the penthouse, the silence of the library.

Sthyra aims to evoke desire. We borrow techniques from cinematography and fashion photography to create visuals that resonate with sophisticated buyers. From mood-setting films to hyper-realistic VR, we craft the assets that define your brand's exclusivity.
